               Crowdfunding</funder>
            <funder>The second phase of the Bodleian First Folio project was made possible by a lead gift from Dr Geoffrey Eibl-Kaye and generous support from the Sallie Dickson Memorial Fund/Dallas Shakespeare Club Fund, Mr James Barber, and a private individual. The Bodleian Libraries are very grateful for this additional support, which brings new features to the digitized First Folio, enabling more efficient and intuitive use for all with an interest in Shakespeare, early modern drama, theatre and book history.</funder>

                        Droeshout: sculpsit¬∑ London.". The plate exists in 2 states: 1. The earlier
                        state has lighter shading generall ; 2. Later state has heavier shading,
                        especially around the collar, and minor differences particularly with the
                        jawline and moustache. The vast majority of surviving copies have the plate
                        in the second state which has led some scholars to conclude that the earlier
                        state was a proof. The portrait in this copy is the second state.

                        Derbyshire at some point in the early 18th century. It stayed in the
                        family‚Äôs possession until <date when="1906">1906</date>, when it was

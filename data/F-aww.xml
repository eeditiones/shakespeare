                    Crowdfunding</funder>
                <funder>The second phase of the Bodleian First Folio project was made possible by a lead gift from Dr Geoffrey Eibl-Kaye and generous support from the Sallie Dickson Memorial Fund/Dallas Shakespeare Club Fund, Mr James Barber, and a private individual. The Bodleian Libraries are very grateful for this additional support, which brings new features to the digitized First Folio, enabling more efficient and intuitive use for all with an interest in Shakespeare, early modern drama, theatre and book history.</funder>

                            <decoNote>With an engraved title-page portrait of the author signed: "Martin-
                                Droeshout: sculpsit¬∑ London.". The plate exists in 2 states: 1. The earlier
                                state has lighter shading generall ; 2. Later state has heavier shading,
                                especially around the collar, and minor differences particularly with the
                                jawline and moustache. The vast majority of surviving copies have the plate
                                in the second state which has led some scholars to conclude that the earlier
                                state was a proof. The portrait in this copy is the second state.

                            <p>Acquired by the Bodleian in 1623, presumably in sheets. It
                                was sent out to <persName>William Wildgoose</persName> on <date when="1624-02-17">17 February 1624</date> for binding (see: Library
                                Records e.258, fol. 48r) and upon its return chained in Duke Humfrey at
                                shelfmark S 2.17 Art. It is listed in the Bodleian‚Äôs <date when="1635">1635</date> catalogue of printed books but was gone by the publication
                                of the next catalogue in <date when="1674">1674</date>, replaced by the

                                to the disposal of this copy, but there is a record of a sale of
                                "superfluous library books" to <persName>Richard Davis</persName>, a
                                bookseller in Oxford, in <date when="1664">1664</date> for the sum of <num value="24">¬£24</num>.</p>
                            <p>After leaving the Bodleian this copy entered
                                the collection of <persName>Richard Turbutt</persName> of Ogston Hall,
                                Derbyshire at some point in the early 18th century. It stayed in the
                                family‚Äôs possession until <date when="1906">1906</date>, when it was
                                reacquired by the Bodleian for the sum of <num value="3000">¬£3000</num>,

                <funder>The second phase of the Bodleian First Folio project was made possible by a lead gift from Dr
                    Geoffrey Eibl-Kaye and generous support from the Sallie Dickson Memorial Fund/Dallas Shakespeare
                    Club Fund, Mr James Barber, and a private individual. The Bodleian Libraries are very grateful for
                    this additional support, which brings new features to the digitized First Folio, enabling more
                    efficient and intuitive use for all with an interest in Shakespeare, early modern drama, theatre and
                    book history.</funder>

                            <decoNote>With an engraved title-page portrait of the author signed: "Martin- Droeshout:
                                sculpsit¬∑ London.". The plate exists in 2 states: 1. The earlier state has lighter
                                shading generall ; 2. Later state has heavier shading, especially around the collar, and
                                minor differences particularly with the jawline and moustache. The vast majority of
                                surviving copies have the plate in the second state which has led some scholars to
                                conclude that the earlier state was a proof. The portrait in this copy is the second
                                state. </decoNote>

                            <p>Two MS verses on first endpaper verso: 1. 9 lines of verse by an unknown author, first
                                line reads "An active swain to make a leap was seen". 2. A copy of Ben Jonson‚Äôs printed
                                "To the Reader"; MS note on t.p. (mutilated) appears to read "Honest [Shakes]peare".
                                Minor annotations on leaf 2n4 (Macbeth). All in an early English hand, presumably added
                                after leaving the Library.</p>
